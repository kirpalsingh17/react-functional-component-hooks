# React App

This is a sample React app that demonstrates the use of hooks such as useState, useEffect, useRef, useReducer, useCallback and useMemo.

## Getting Started
To run the app, follow these steps:

+ Clone the repository to your local machine.
+ Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
+ Run the command npm install to install the project dependencies.
+ Run the command npm start to start the development server.

## Components
The app contains the following components:

**First:** A component that demonstrates the use of useContext hook to access global state.

**UseRef:** A component that demonstrates the use of useRef hook to maintain a mutable reference to a value across renders.

**UseReducer:** A component that demonstrates the use of useReducer hook to manage complex state.

**UseCallback:** A component that demonstrates the use of useCallback hook to optimize performance by memoizing a function.

**UseMemo:** A component that demonstrates the use of useMemo hook to optimize performance by memoizing a computed value.

## Hooks
The app also demonstrates the use of the following hooks:

**useState:** A hook that allows state to be maintained in a functional component.

**useEffect:** A hook that allows side effects to be performed in a functional component.

**useContext:** A hook that allows global state to be accessed in a functional component.
